# dotfiles
"Dotfiles" are the funky little files in your *nix-based home directory that allow you to customize your nerdery.
This is to make it easier to setup ratpoison interaction and programming environment for me.
I tried to keep them nice and tidy, but err.. life happend.

=========================================
* Mix of scripts, configs, etc. that I use on my system.
* Please do not blindly copy the config files and expect them to work.
